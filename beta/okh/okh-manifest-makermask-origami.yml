health-safety-notice: These instructions do not guarantee protection against transmission of any
  diseases. Commercially available masks meet regulatory guidelines, but
  homemade masks may not. Mask designs have not been FDA approved or cleared.
  Homemade masks are to be used at your own risk. Due to variability of
  materials and construction, the mask’s safety or effectiveness is not proven
  and cannot be assumed. Information and instructions are not guaranteed to be
  complete and accurate. Manufacturers and distributors are responsible for
  ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Desperate times
  call for desperate measures. Stay safe.
